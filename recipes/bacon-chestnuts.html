        <h2>Description</h2>
        Soy sauce, smoky bacon and sweet brown sugar dress up water chestnuts for a festive party appetizer. The crunchy centers are a great counter to the crisp, meaty bacon and the sticky-sweet glaze. This is perhaps my favorite appetizer, and one that I fondly remember eating during holidays at my grandparents' house as a child.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two 8-ounce cans whole water chestnuts, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>14 slices bacon, cut crosswise into thirds</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup firmly-packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
