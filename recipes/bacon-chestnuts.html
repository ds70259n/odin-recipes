        <h2>Description</h2>
        Soy sauce, smoky bacon and sweet brown sugar dress up water chestnuts for a festive party appetizer. The crunchy centers are a great counter to the crisp, meaty bacon and the sticky-sweet glaze. This is perhaps my favorite appetizer, and one that I fondly remember eating during holidays at my grandparents' house as a child.
