        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is 
        “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian 
        – and that’s exactly what it is! It’s mainly 
        rice with just a little bit of meat and 
        just onion for the vegetables. The thing 
        that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice 
        dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis,
        a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown 
        and caramelises the rice when it cooks. 
        Typically it’s served with a sunny side up egg
        (love how the yolk runs into the rice!) and a 
        side of fresh cucumber and tomato (no dressing) 
        to make a meal of it.</p>
       
       
        <p>I love how much of a comfort food it is to me; 
        it reminds of sitting around the table with 
        my family eating a savory, cozy home-cooked meal! 
        It’s a simple recipe, you won’t 
        need to hunt down any unusual ingredients, and 
        it’s one of my favourite Indonesian foods. I hope 
        you enjoy!</p>
