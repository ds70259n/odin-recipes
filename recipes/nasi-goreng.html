        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is 
        “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian 
        – and that’s exactly what it is! It’s mainly 
        rice with just a little bit of meat and 
        just onion for the vegetables. The thing 
        that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice 
        dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis,
        a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown 
        and caramelises the rice when it cooks. 
        Typically it’s served with a sunny side up egg
        (love how the yolk runs into the rice!) and a 
        side of fresh cucumber and tomato (no dressing) 
        to make a meal of it.</p>
       
       
        <p>I love how much of a comfort food it is to me; 
        it reminds of sitting around the table with 
        my family eating a savory, cozy home-cooked meal! 
        It’s a simple recipe, you won’t 
        need to hunt down any unusual ingredients, and 
        it’s one of my favourite Indonesian foods. I hope 
        you enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add chilli and garlic, stir for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add onion, cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, cook until it mostly turns white, 
                then add 1 tbsp kecap manis and cook for a further 
                1 minute or until chicken is mostly cooked through 
                and a bit caramelised.</li>
            <li>Add rice, 2 tbsp kecap manis and shrimp paste, 
                if using. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes 
                until sauce reduces down and rice grains start to 
                caramelise (key for flavour!).</li>
            <li>Serve, garnished with garnishes of choice 
                (green onions, red chilli, fried shallots).</li>
            <li>Serve as a side for Asian main dishes or as part of a 
                large spread, Asian or not!
                <ul>
                    <li>Make it a meal traditional Indonesian Style! Serve with
                    a fried egg sunny side up (runny yolk), tomato wedges
                    and slices of cucumber on the side.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Kecap Manis</strong>(sometimes called Ketjap Manis) 
                is an Indonesian sweet soy sauce that is thicker than other 
                soy sauces. Sometimes just labelled as "sweet soy sauce". 
                Consistency resembles maple syrup.</p>
                <p><strong>Also easy to make your own!</strong> 
                Just combine 1/4 cup ordinary soy sauce (I use Kikkoman) 
                and 1/4 cup brown sugar over medium heat. Bring to a simmer 
                and reduce until it becomes a maple syrup consistency. It 
                will thicken more when it cools.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chilli</strong> - I use 2 birds eye or Thai red chillies, adds a 
                mild warmth, doesn't make it spicy. Adjust to taste. 
                <strong>Chilli paste</strong> can also be used instead - add it when 
                you add the rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Day old cooked rice</strong> - All types of fried rice are best 
                made using day old cooked rice that has been refrigerated 
                overnight. It dries it out, making it easier to stir fry 
                to evenly coat the grains with the flavourings. 
                TIP: Keep bags of cooked rice in the freezer! Fabulous 
                for fried rice, or even using plain.</li>
            <li><p><strong>Shrimp paste</strong> - Adds depth of flavour and complexity, but 
                is optional. Traditional dish uses belacan which is dried shrimp 
                blocks, requires crumbling then toasting prior to use. Same flavour 
                achieved with any shrimp paste which you can just dollop in. Any 
                shrimp paste brand/type is fine.</p>
                <p><strong>Still tasty WITHOUT</strong> shrimp paste. <strong>SUB</strong>
                with more kecap mans OR 1 tbsp fish sauce!</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fried shallots</strong> are slices shallots that have been fried until crunchy. 
                They are a great garnish and add a pop of texture to the dish but are 
                optional because it's not traditional!</li>
            <li><strong>Make this GLUTEN FREE</strong> by making your own kecap manis 
                using Tamari.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage</strong> - as with all fried rice, it keeps great for a day or two 
                in the fridge then I find it gets a bit dry. Salvage it with 
                a sprinkle of water then microwave it - makes it all steamy and 
                moist again! Do the same if you freeze it.</li>
        </ul>
