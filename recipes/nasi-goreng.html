        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is 
        “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian 
        – and that’s exactly what it is! It’s mainly 
        rice with just a little bit of meat and 
        just onion for the vegetables. The thing 
        that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice 
        dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis,
        a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown 
        and caramelises the rice when it cooks. 
        Typically it’s served with a sunny side up egg
        (love how the yolk runs into the rice!) and a 
        side of fresh cucumber and tomato (no dressing) 
        to make a meal of it.</p>
       
       
        <p>I love how much of a comfort food it is to me; 
        it reminds of sitting around the table with 
        my family eating a savory, cozy home-cooked meal! 
        It’s a simple recipe, you won’t 
        need to hunt down any unusual ingredients, and 
        it’s one of my favourite Indonesian foods. I hope 
        you enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Kecap Manis</strong>(sometimes called Ketjap Manis) 
                is an Indonesian sweet soy sauce that is thicker than other 
                soy sauces. Sometimes just labelled as "sweet soy sauce". 
                Consistency resembles maple syrup, available in most 
                supermarkets in Australia.</p>
                <p><strong>Also easy to make your own!</strong> 
                Just combine 1/4 cup ordinary soy sauce (I use Kikkoman) 
                and 1/4 cup brown sugar over medium heat. Bring to a simmer 
                and reduce until it becomes a maple syrup consistency. It 
                will thicken more when it cools.</p>
